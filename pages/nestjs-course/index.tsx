          <h2 className="mb-2">Let's face it - Learning NestJS is hard ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
          <p>
            NestJS has emerged as a go-to framework for building scalable and efficient server-side
            applications. Many job postings now list NestJS as a desired skill for backend
            developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if you've attempted to learn NestJS on your own, you might have found it
            overwhelming. There are numerous concepts to grasp, and many tutorials assume a
            significant amount of prior knowledge and experience.
          </p>
          <img src="https://i.imgflip.com/8tqoso.jpg" alt="old man meme" />
          <p>
            Perhaps you've found yourself trapped in tutorial hell, going through countless
            tutorials without making concrete progress.
          </p>
          <p>You're eager to learn NestJS, but the journey hasn't been smooth. üòï</p>
          <h2 className="mb-2">I'm here to help ü´°</h2>
          <p>
            Over the past year, I've been developing the ultimate project-focused NestJS course.
          </p>
          <p>
            You won't simply watch me code passively. The course is packed with practical exercises,
            real-world inspired projects, and engaging coding challenges. It's a unique learning
            experience tailored specifically for NestJS enthusiasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll learn NestJS from the ground up, constructing a solid foundation and mental model
            that will enable you to understand NestJS and tackle complex problems effectively.
          </p>
          <img src="https://i.imgflip.com/8tqpny.jpg" alt="yoda meme" />
          <p>
            I'll share the numerous insights and best practices I've gained from years of
            professional NestJS development.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we won't stop at NestJS alone. The course covers wider server side development
            concepts like working with asynchronous queues, handling errors, and writing tests.
          </p>
          <h2 className="mb-2">The truth is, NestJS is awesome üôå</h2>
          <p>
            Once you grasp the core concepts, NestJS becomes a powerful ally in your backend
            development journey. I've worked with various server-side frameworks, and NestJS stands
            out for its ability to boost productivity and maintainability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building scalable and robust backend applications is no simple feat. It requires careful
            consideration of performance, security, and architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            To truly harness the power of NestJS, we first need to establish a strong foundation and
            understand the conventions and patterns that make NestJS so effective. Then, we'll
            explore how leveraging the right tools and techniques can supercharge our NestJS
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the path to becoming a confident and proficient NestJS developer. It's a
            rewarding experience, and I want to guide you along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me show you how this course will make your learning journey enjoyable and
            transformative.
