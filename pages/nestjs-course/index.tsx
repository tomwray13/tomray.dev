          <h2 className="mb-2">Let's face it - Learning NestJS is hard ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
          <p>
            NestJS has emerged as a go-to framework for building scalable and efficient server-side
            applications.
          </p>
          <p>Many job postings now list NestJS as a desired skill for backend developers.</p>
          <p>
            However, if you've attempted to learn NestJS on your own, you might have found it
            overwhelming.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are numerous concepts to grasp (like dependency injection, OOP and decorators) and
            many tutorials assume a significant amount of prior knowledge and experience.
          </p>
          <img src="https://i.imgflip.com/8tqoso.jpg" alt="old man meme" />
          <p>
            Perhaps you've found yourself trapped in tutorial hell, going through countless
            tutorials without making concrete progress.
          </p>
          <p>You're eager to learn NestJS, but the journey hasn't been smooth. üòï</p>
          <h2 className="mb-2">What if you had a roadmap to NestJS mastery üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è?</h2>
          <p>
            Over the past year, I've been developing the ultimate project-focused NestJS course.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve spent literally hundreds of hours thinking about the best way to structure a
            learning path that is focused on first principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            You won't simply watch me code passively. The course is packed with practical exercises,
            real-world inspired projects, and engaging coding challenges. It's a unique learning
            experience tailored specifically for NestJS enthusiasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll learn NestJS from the ground up, constructing a solid foundation and mental model
            that will enable you to understand NestJS and tackle complex problems effectively.
          </p>
          <img src="https://i.imgflip.com/8tqpny.jpg" alt="yoda meme" />
          <p>
            I'll share many insights and best practices I've gained from years of professional
            NestJS development.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we won't stop at NestJS alone. The course covers wider server side development
            concepts like working with asynchronous queues, handling errors, and writing tests.
          </p>
          <h2 className="mb-2">Your future as a NestJS pro ‚ö°Ô∏è</h2>
          <p>
            Imagine being able to confidently build and deploy scalable, high-performance backend
            applications using NestJS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Picture yourself taking on more complex projects, impressing colleagues and clients as
            well as increasing your earning potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the right guidance and structured learning, you can achieve this in just 30 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            No more piecing together scattered tutorials or feeling overwhelmed by new concepts.
          </p>
          <p>
