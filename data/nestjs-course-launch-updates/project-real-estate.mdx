Project:

- Ability to import real estate listings from a CSV file.
- Ability to view a history of imports.
- Ability to view an import and the status of each listing. Status comes through in real-time
- Ability to see all listings

Implementation:

- Uploading csv files and validating them
  -- implement abstracted csv service
- Defining imports schema and storing record to database
- Loop over each row and send it to listings queue for processing
- We have no way of creating listings, so create listings module and service
- Add a listing producer to send listings to queue
- In the imports module, use listings producer to send listings to queue
- Create a consumer to process listings in listings module
- Bonus: storing respective csv file in S3 bucket
<!-- - Send file off to queue for processing. Queue can be defined -->
