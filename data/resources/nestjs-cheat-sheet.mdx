![NestJS cheat sheet](/static/images/nestjs-cheat-sheet/banner.png)

Hey there!

Thanks for checking out my NestJS cheat sheet.

I've made this cheat sheet in blog post format so I can easily make updates and add contributions moving forward.

Ready? Let's dive in!

## ‚òùÔ∏è Turn on strict Typescript configs

Out of the box, the default NestJS Typescript config set up is:

```json:tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "declaration": true,
    "removeComments": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "target": "es2017",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "incremental": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strictNullChecks": false,
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "strictBindCallApply": false,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": false,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": false
  }
}

```

It's widely seen as best practice to enforce strict mode in your Typescript configs to get the full benefits of Typescript.

[This article](https://maxkovalevsky.com/what-is-strict-mode-in-typescript-and-why-and-when-you-should-use-it/) from Max does a great job of explaining what strict mode is and why you should use it.

Strict mode is actually made up of 7 configuration options which are all switched on if strict mode is set.

Check out [this article](https://dev.to/jsdev/strict-mode-typescript-j8p) for some examples on what each configuration gives you incase you want to toggle some specific ones on or off.

The default `tsconfig.json` file from NestJS includes 3 of these (all set to `false` by default) - let's replace them with setting strict mode on:

```json:tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "declaration": true,
    "removeComments": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "target": "es2017",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "incremental": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    // "strictNullChecks": false,
    // "noImplicitAny": false,
    // "strictBindCallApply": false,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": false,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": false,
    "strict": true, // strict mode on!
  }
}

```

I also like to include a couple of other configs:

`noUnusedLocals`: Report errors on unused local variables (e.g. you declate a variable with `const` and then never user it)

`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`: Prevents runtime errors caused by unexpected undefined values. This one's best explained by an example:

```ts
// define an array
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]

// access array with index 3
const example = numbers[3]

// this will cause a runtime error because index 3 does not exist!
console.log(example.toFixed(2))
return 'Hello World!'
```

By switching on `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, you will be forced (you'll see the red squigly lines in your IDE) to handle the `undefined` scenario which will help prevent runtime errors. Set this in your tsconfig and thank yourself later üòâ.

Putting it all together, here's the TSconfig file:

```json:tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "declaration": true,
    "removeComments": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "target": "es2017",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "incremental": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": false,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": false,
    "strict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true

  }
}

```

## üîí Add HTTP header security

Out of the box, NestJS uses the default HTTP headers which can open you up to security vulnerabilities.

Thankfully, that's why [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) exists - to increase the HTTP header security and prevent common exposures to security risks.

It's also super easy to install in a NestJS app too.

If you're running an Express server:

```shell
npm i --save helmet
```

And then apply the package as global middleware:

```ts:main.ts
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import helmet from 'helmet';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.use(helmet());
  ... // other configs
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();

```

If you're running a Fastify server:

```shell
npm i --save @fastify/helmet
```

And then apply the package as global middleware:

```ts:main.ts
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import {
  FastifyAdapter,
  NestFastifyApplication,
} from '@nestjs/platform-fastify';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create<NestFastifyApplication>(
    AppModule,
    new FastifyAdapter()
  );
  await app.register(helmet)
  ... // other configs
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();

```

## üî• Deploy with a command to Cloud Run

While a more comprehensive CI/CD workflow will be required as a project grows in complexity, for prototyping I've found it really helpful to deploy on the fly to [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) using the GCP CLI.

There are a couple of prerequisites:

1. Having a [production ready Dockerfile](/nestjs-docker-production)
2. Having the Google Cloud Platform CLI installed on your machine (and a GCP account)

With the above just run this in the root of your project:

```bash
gcloud run deploy
```

The first delpoyment will take you through a few set up steps, but then after that it'll be a breeze everytime you need to push up a change üòé.

For a more detailed deep-dive on the above set up and deploying to Cloud Run, check out [this post](/deploy-nestjs-cloud-run).

## üí∏ Free caching with Redis Labs

When considering which cloud caching provider to use, take a look at [Redis Labs](https://redis.com/).

They have a free plan that gives you a 30MB caching service.

You only get one Redis service per account, but it's super quick and easy to get up-and running.

This free plan likely won't be enough for production - but you can easily upgrade to an appropiate plan.

[Heroku](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis) also has a free plan with a 25MB memory limit (slightly less than Redis Labs above).
