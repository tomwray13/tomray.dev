![How to use environment variables in NestJS with the Config Module](/static/images/nestjs-config/nestjs-config.png)

Sooner or later you'll need to use environment variables in your NestJS app.

This tutorial covers exactly this by using the [NestJS Config Module](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration) to use env files and their respective environment variables.

We'll start with a minimal setup that will allow you to use `process.env` anywhere in your NestJS app, then progress to a more advanced setup using custom configuration files.

Ready? Let's go!

## Install dependencies

In a classic NodeJS project, you'd need to install the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables.

NestJS comes with a built-in config module (that uses the dotenv package under the hood) that you can use to read environment variables.

```bash
npm i --save @nestjs/config
```

## Add the Config Module configuration

With the package installed, we can now use the config module.

Import it into the root `AppModule` along with the `forRoot()` static method:

```typescript:app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot(),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

```

**Please note:** As you add more imports to your `app.module.ts` file, keep the `ConfigModule` as the first import. Otherwise the other imports won't have access to the environment variables.

## You can now use `process.env`

Assuming you're using the default `.env` file in your project, you'll now have access to your environment variables by using `process.env` anywhere in your NestJS app.

For example, you could use an environment variable to dynamically set the port of your app (this is required if you're [deploying your NestJS app to Cloud Run](/deploy-nestjs-cloud-run#configure-a-port-environment-variable)) with a fallback value:

```typescript:main.ts
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT) : 3000);
}
bootstrap();

```

While this approach works, it doesn't offer any type safety. It also means if you use a fallback (like in the example above), everytime you use the environment variable you'd need to define the fallback again. We'll go into a more advanced approach in the next section which will cover these challenges.

## Using custom configuration files

Instead of using `process.env` in your NestJS app whenever you need to access an environment variable, you can instead use custom configuration files.

[Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/configuration) uses a very similar approach where you have custom configuration files inside a `config` directory which point to environment variables.

For example, here's a configuration file inside a `config` directory:

```typescript:config/configuration.ts
export default () => ({
  port: parseInt(process.env.PORT) || 3000,
  pokemonService: {
    apiKey: process.env.POKEMEON_KEY,
  }
});
```

You will need to import this configuration file into the `ConfigModule` by using the `load` property:

```typescript:app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';
import config from './config/configuration';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      load: [config]
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

```

To now use the values set in the configuration file in one of the modules in our NestJS app, we'd need to import the `ConfigModule` (just like you would with any provider):

```typescript:feature.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  // ...
})
```

That being said, I prefer to set the `isGlobal` property to true in the `ConfigModule` in `app.module.ts` so that it's available everywhere in the app (and I don't need to import the Config Module everytime).

```typescript:app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';
import config from './config/configuration';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      isGlobal: true,
      load: [config]
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

```

By the way, if you'd prefer to make your configuration files more granular and split them into different files, you can do that as well.

```typescript:app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';
import base from './config/base.config';
import database from './config/database.config';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      isGlobal: true,
      load: [base, database] // split your configuration files into separate files
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

```

Let's finally get into actually using the values set in our configuration file(s)!

Using this configuration file as an example:

```typescript:config/configuration.ts
export default () => ({
  port: parseInt(process.env.PORT) || 3000,
  pokemonService: {
    apiKey: process.env.POKEMEON_KEY,
  }
});
```

You'll need to inject the `ConfigService` using constructor injection (same as all other services you import), and then you'll have access to the `configService.get` method as shown below:

```typescript:feature.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config';

@Injectable()
export class FeatureService {

  constructor(private readonly configService: ConfigService) {}

  someFunction(param: string) {
    const port = this.configService.get<number>('port');
      // ...
  }

  someOtherFunction(param: string) {
    const pokemonAPIKey = this.configService.get<string>('pokemonService.apiKey');
      // ...
  }
}

```

The above code works great. However, what happens if you forget to set the environment variables in your env file?

If your TSconfig file has the `strictNullChecks` property set to `true`, then the above code would show a compiler error because the `configService.get` method would return `undefined` if the environment variable was not set.

To solve this, we can leverage a best practice:

Throw an exception during the server startup if you're missing required environment variables.

We'll cover that in the next section.

## Validating environment variables

To solve the challenge described in the previous section, the NestJS docs suggest validation using a [schema method](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration#schema-validation) and a [custom validate function](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration#custom-validate-function). They're worth checking out.

Another technique is to throw an error in the constructor of the class if the configuration values you need are not what you expect.

Here's how the example from the previous section would look implementing this approach:

```typescript:feature.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config';

@Injectable()
export class FeatureService {
  private port: number;
  private pokemonAPIKey: string;

  constructor(private readonly configService: ConfigService) {
    const port = this.configService.get<number>('port');
    const pokemonAPIKey = this.configService.get<string>('pokemonService.apiKey');

    if (!port || !pokemonAPIKey) {
      throw new Error(`Environment variables are missing`);
    }

    this.port = port;
    this.pokemonAPIKey = pokemonAPIKey;
  }

  someFunction(param: string) {
    this.port // you now have access to the port variable
  }

  someOtherFunction(param: string) {
    this.pokemonAPIKey // you now have access to the pokemonAPIKey variable
  }
}

```

In the constructor, if either of the environment variables are missing, an error is thrown.

I quite like this approach for the following reasons:

- If any of the environment variables are missing, the server will fail the startup process including the error message (helpful for debugging when deploying / other developers getting the project setup locally)
- It feels very contextual. When a developer is looking at the code, it's clear what these private fields are and that they will never be `undefined` when they're used in the methods.

What do you think? I'd be interested to know your approach to validating these configuration values. Let me know in the comments below.

## Other practical use-cases of the Config Module

There might be other variables which are not secrets (i.e. so wouldn't be set in the `.env` file) that should be shared across your application.

For example, in a recent project I wanted to setup some Regex validation for a UK postcode. This validation was required in a few places, so I didn't want duplicate code.

So I created a custom configuration file called `regex.config.ts`:

```typescript:config/regex.config.ts
export default () => ({
  regex: {
    postcode: new RegExp(/^[a-z]{1,2}\d[a-z\d]?\s*\d[a-z]{2}$/i),
    // other regex rules here...
  },
});

```

Ensured it was imported correctly:

```typescript:app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';
import base from './config/base.config';
import database from './config/database.config';
import regex from './config/regex.config';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      isGlobal: true,
      load: [base, database, regex]
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

```

And then used this value in different providers:

```typescript:feature.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config';

@Injectable()
export class FeatureService {
  private postcodeRegex: RegExp;

  constructor(private readonly configService: ConfigService) {
    const postcodeRegex = this.configService.get<RegExp>('regex.postcode');

    if (!postcodeRegex) {
      throw new Error(`Regex postcode validation required`);
    }

    this.postcodeRegex = postcodeRegex;
  }

  someFunction(postcode: string) {
    if (this.postcodeRegex.test(postcode)) {
      // ...
    }
  }

}

```
