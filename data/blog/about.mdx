Hey there! Thanks for stopping by.

Here are some rapid fire bullets about me:

- 🇬🇧 I'm Tom, from the UK and currently live in Brighton.
- 💼 I work on all things dev and product at [Billing Better](https://billingbetter.co.uk/)
- ⌨️ My tech career began as a UX/UI designer at a startup studio. Over the years I transitioned to the development side (all things JavaScript) and haven't looked back!
- 🧠 Self taught with some great mentors on the way - the learning never stops
- ⚽️ Enjoy playing football and running in the [South Downs](https://cmscdn.boutique-retreats.co.uk/Sussex/South%20Downs%20National%20Park/Scenery-2.jpg) 🌅 as often as I can!
- 😺 My partner and I have a cat named [Arnold](https://twitter.com/scalablecss/status/1261656062073200641?s=20) who is a little monster.

In this blog, I'm going to explore the backend Javascript ecosystem with in-depth, project-based tutorials.

At the time of writing, I'm particularly interested in the following stack/tooling:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [NestJS](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)

This blog is built-in Next.js leveraging [Timothy's](https://twitter.com/timlrxxn) [NextJS starter repo](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) - thank you Timothy 🤟!

Let's dive in 🤿.
